# PCB-Designing-Project-1(IR-Sensor-Design)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this series for beginner we are going to learn PCB designing our first project is IR (Infrared) sensor is designed from scratch using KiCad, starting from schematic capture to PCB layout. The design includes a two-layer PCB and follows basic PCB designing principles. All components are properly referenced. 
The project includes proper component selection, schematic connections, footprint assignment, PCB placement, and routing. All components are clearly referenced, and standard PCB design keywords and conventions are followed also in this series of PCB I tell how to order PCB(from JLC ,EDA) of any color with or without component solder with full customization
